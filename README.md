# FantasyFootballGUI
Fully functional Java fantasy football application/GUI.

Comprised of six classes: FantasyFootballGUI, League, FantasyTeam, Player, FreeAgents, and DataManager.

Complete with add/drop players functionality, auto-saves progress, functionality for tab key/enter key, etc.

Last two functions I have yet to build out are the "View League Rules" button and the "Set League Name" button.
